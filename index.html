          I chose to redesign this website because I frequented this family
          owned restaurant in Charlotte over the summer and was disappointed
          that their website was not as good as their service.

          The website has several issues which are presented in the below. The
          numbers in the list correspond to the numbers in the image, labelling
          where the issue is on the original website.

            <li>Random Text</li>
            <li>No coherent order to tabs (Why isn't the Home tab first?)</li>

              Information about holidays is in tiny font and hard to notice

            <li>Not clear that the pictures are supposed to be links</li>
            <li>Missing or uninformative alt text</li>
            <li>Random links make the page extend unnecessarily</li>
            <li>Unnecessary clutter advertising the website makers</li>
            <li>Redundant links on bottom</li>

          was also used to detect possible accessibility problems. This web
          accessibility tool had similar findings. Its main complaints were the
          lack of alt text and low contrast.
        </p>
        <p>Some other findings were</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Missing first level heading</li>
          <li>No page regions</li>
          <li>Three redundant links</li>
          <li>One empty link</li>
          <li>Language missing or invalid</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          I agree with these findings for the most part. I would add that the
          text color is not only low contrast, but also distracting and visually
          repellent.

      <div id="wireframe" class="section">
        <h1>Wireframes</h1>
        <p>
          Using Balsamiq, I created 3 wireframes of the redesigned website. Each
          is for a different screen size (mobile, tablet, and desktop). Scroll
          through each wireframe to show how it fixes the problems mentioned
          earlier.
        </p>
        <h2>Desktop Wireframe</h2>
        <div class="screenshot-container">
          <img src="assets/wireframe-desktop.png" alt="desktop wireframe" />

        <h2>Mobile Wireframe</h2>
        <div class="screenshot-container">
          <img
            src="assets/wireframe-phone.png"

            alt="mobile wireframe"
          />
        </div>
        <h2>Tablet Wireframe</h2>
        <div class="screenshot-container">
          <img src="assets/wireframe-ipad.png" alt="tablet wireframe" />

      <div id="styleguide" class="section">
        <h1>Style Guide</h1>
        <p>
          This style guide was created using Figma. The logo and red color were
          both taken from the original website. I changed the background color
          to a beige, off-white color and made a new hover style. The icons were
          all created with figma using the shapes tools. The font used here is
          Roboto because Helvetica was not included in the Figma fonts, but for
          the redesign I used Helvetica.

      <div id="redesign" class="section">
        <h1>Redesign</h1>
        <p>
          Now that we have identified the problems, created wireframes, and
          prototypes, it is finally time to redesign the website.
